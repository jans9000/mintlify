Figure 1. Platform plans

The focus of the **Essential** product plan is knowing the last reported location, historical locations, and journeys of every asset in the fleet. The **Professional** product plan adds the possibility for geozone visit analysis, stock management & condition monitoring using external sensors. The **Analytics** product plan goes a whole lot further by analyzing the usage patterns of those assets and providing KPIs which allow one to optimize immediately the usage/capacity/distribution of those assets. All platform packages provide APIs to integrate the functionality they provide to external systems.

## Detailed plan information

An overview of services and features that are included in the different plans is shown in the table below.

All described features are also available via a responsive web-app for any mobile device.
