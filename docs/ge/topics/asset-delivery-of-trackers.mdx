Welcome to the Sensolus documentation center. We are happy to get you started with our asset tracking solution.

When you ordered trackers and platform subscriptions from Sensolus, a box containing the trackers will be delivered to your location.

A virtual representation of each physical tracker is automatically generated on the Sensolus platform in your organization's account.

To access your tracker information and begin utilizing the insights offered on the platform, please navigate to [https://cloud.sensolus.com/login](https://cloud.sensolus.com/login) and use the login credentials you received from your sales contact.
