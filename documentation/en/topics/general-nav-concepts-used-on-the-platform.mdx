title: "Concepts Used By The Platform"

The main concepts that you should understand when starting to work with the Sensolus platform.

To fully understand the capabilities and features of the platform, it is important that you are aware of the following key concepts.

## Asset

An asset is a physical object to which a tracker is attached to enable remote localization and monitoring. An asset can be any type of object: a trailer, a returnable transport package (RTP), a container, a machine, a dolly, etc.

## Tracker

A tracker, or 'asset tracker', is a device that is attached to an asset in order to monitor the location of the asset (or monitor additional asset properties if more advanced sensors are included). The tracker makes it possible to create a digital twin of your asset in the platform. Different types of trackers exist: connected trackers (trackers that make a direct connection to the internet and have an internal battery), externally powered trackers (trackers that make a direct connection to the internet but need to be wired to an external battery) and beacon trackers (trackers that do not make a direct connection to the internet and have an internal battery). Trackers send data to the platform, and are configured by the platform.

## Sensolus platform

The Sensolus platform is the online environment where you can remotely monitor your assets and where you have access to all the insights into the data provided by your asset trackers. The platform is also used to remotely configure the trackers. You can access the platform via stickntrack.sensolus.com.

## Geozone

A geozone (or geographical zone) is a geographical boundary that defines an area of interest such as a warehouse or parking lot. Once defined it allows to get insights regarding stock levels, stay times, in-and-out flows and much more. Geozones are used to group raw location data points and translate this into recognizable locations, and to provide context and meaning to asset localization. For example, a geozone can be used to count all assets in a specific warehouse location.

## Asset detail page

The Asset detail page provides detailed information on a single selected asset. It is accessible by click on a single tracker from the asset list: Home → Assets → Asset list → Asset name.\
